        <p>
          I am currently a student at BYU studying Computer Science and I love coding!
          I also have a lot of other hobbies including playing the piano, playing tennis,
          and baking.

        <ul id="projects">
          <li><strong>Datalog Interpreter:</strong> For one of my classes, I programmed
          a basic datalog interpreter in C++. We learned all about grammars and how interpreters work.</li>
          <br /><li><strong>Creative Website:</strong> In high school, I created a website for one of
          my classes that had a drawing whiteboard embedded in the website. Using Javascript,
          we even made it possible to change the colors of the drawing pen.</li>
          <br /><li><strong>Login Website:</strong>Again in high school, we were learning about
          databases, so we created a website with a secure login that connected to our online database.</li>
